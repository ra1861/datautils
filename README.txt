This project has a goal to provide utility functions I found useful in working with (Big) data engineering tasks.
E.g. inspect a list of data partitions and collect missing datetime entities.
Example:  Given list of partitions between "2018-01-01" and "2018-12-31", find missing one.

Limitations: to only use standard Python modules.
Versions: Verified for Python 3.x.
